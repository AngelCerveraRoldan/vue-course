# Notes

## Vue Developer Environment

Notes on the basics of:
- WebPack
- Babel
- PostCSS
- SASS
- ESLint

## Webpack
Applications will have many files (css, java, images, ...), but we want there to be as little files as possible as the user will have to download them all to run the app.

Webpack will compress everything into as little files as possible. Bundling files is important, as loading a 20kb file is faster than loading 2 10kb files. 
## Babel
This is a javascript compiler that will let us use js syntax that may not be available in some browsers. 
## SASS
Sass is a stylesheet language just like CSS
## ESLint
Linting is the process of reviewing your code for consistencies. 

ESLint is a code quality reviewer.
